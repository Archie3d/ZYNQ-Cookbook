# How to Understand the Basics of U-boot #

Using u-boot for ZYNQ to load Linux doesn't need users to understand how in low level it works, especially if PetaLinux is used.
When bringup for a board is needed, some configuration files needs to be updated and PetaLinux can help with the most of the work.
If more customization is needed, then the deeper understanding of u-boot would be needed.
